.operating system
>>c++ is one of the fastest and most efficient languages.
--there are two thing you need to learn.
1=C++ language meaning the syntax or grammer of this language.
2=Standard library Or STL which collection pre written c++ code.
that provides functionality that is required by many applications.

EXAMPLES 
.data structures list ,map
.Algorithms searching ,sorting
>> To create c++ programs , we use an Integrated Development Enviroment Or IDE.

-------the basics
we will learn this
1.variables and constants
2.naming conventions
3.mathematical expressions
4.writing to and reading from the console
5.working with the standard library
6.comments


>double is using decimal point or floating number

(>>) this operator called Stream insertion operator
> when you want a new  line you will use (<< std::endl;).
> when you want to run something you use (std::cout <<).
>(cout) means character out and can use like print.
>(cin) means to read data.
  the operation (<< insertion) to write data to a stream.
  the operation (>> extraction) to read data from a stream.
Common manipulators:
setW

setprecision:waxay qabata pointga tirada ku so baxde ayey mar walpa go amine
boolalpha 
left:wax walpo gadasheeda lagu qoro waxy ka so muqanayn dhinaca left
right:by defult

--boolean are true or false
--characters are always represent a numbers
--markii la rbo in laba magac lagu soo aqriyo ayado la isticmalyao space waxa looyaqana functionkaas getline kaso qeexo STD.
--Arry elements can be using Accsesing index
